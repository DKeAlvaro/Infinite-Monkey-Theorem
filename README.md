> Exploring the Infinite Monkey Theorem through Evolution 
## Overview
In this assignment, we created a genetic algorithm that simulates a simplified version of the infinite monkey theorem. It tries to evolve a random set of strings to a desired sentence, in this case `"Hello World"`.

We implemented all of our code in Java, using object-oriented programming principles and concepts of populations and genetics.

The goal of this assignment is to have a better understanding of how natural selection works through programming.

### Running the Program
Simply run the class `Practical2` and you will see how many generations it takes to evolve the population to the desired sentence.
